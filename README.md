Full-stack developer: true

I am currectly learning Python for robotics using an Arduino uno and eventually will make prostetics,
that are not as limited as they are today in function and price.
My down time is usually filled with gaming, I also enjoy anything like archery, disc golf, 
and axe throwing when I get a chance.

I have experience with JavaScript, React, TypeScript, NodeJS, PostgreSQL, HTML and CSS.
I can pick up most tools readily, but I have used Netlify and Heroku for hosting, 

Test driven development is important to me to keep my projects on task and working properly.
