Full-stack developer: true

I have experience with React, NodeJS, PostgreSQL, HTML and CSS.
I can pick up most tools readily, but I have used Netlify and Heroku for hosting, 
and I have used Postman for data base activity.
Test driven development is important to me to keep my projects on task and working properly.

I am currectly learning TypeScript ðŸ™Œ

I want to learn Python/C++ for robotics and eventually make prostetics,
that are not as limited as they are today in function and price.
My down time is usually filled with gaming, I also enjoy anything like archery, disc golf, 
and axe throwing when I get a chance.
